# russian-study-tool

a simple "flash card" python study tool app with a repository of russian words

made to be controllable with a 3-foot-pedal set, due to my RSI

also included in this project is a basic computer keyboard/mouse controls with the pedals (use pedals to control the mouse, or press certain key combinations)
